Here I built database structures for fictional companies, created small video games, hand-coded Space Invaders from scratch in Assembly Language, built and coded an Arduino Robot to navigate obstacle courses, a lot of Java and C++ programming for data structures, and much more."

As well, I led the development of V2 of our mobile application written in React Native. I have worked extensively with React/Redux as well as with react hooks. \n\nMore recently, I have been given the opportunity to lead our cybersecurity initiative. As part of our partnership with a number of 3rd parties and our planned expansion into Europe, the need to tighten security and bring our technology up to certain compliance standards has become evident. It is my job to bring us into alignment with these, as well as hardening our security as a whole."

During my time here I have worked in all roles involved in the Water and Sewer Department, with the exception of equipment operating. I worked as a water meter technician programming the meters in people's homes. I worked in location, excavation, installation and repair of water and sewer lines. I learned how to install, dismantle, troubleshoot, and repair the most popular models of fire hydrants. \n\nWhile working for the Water Treatment and Distribution Department, and alongside one partner, we led the first Uni-Directional Flow program our city has done in years. This requires a thorough understanding of the city's water grid to selectively force excessive pressure through a water line in order to clean it. This must be done in a specific order for every line in the city.   "
